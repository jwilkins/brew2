Homebrew 2 Design Bin
=====================
This is just some messing around in the aid of improving Homebrew for revision
two. Don't worry, we'll finish Homebrew 1.0 first.

Feel free to fork and suggest improvements.

Requirements
============
* A GCC compatible compiler
* BSD or GNU curl, tar, unzip
* Ruby 1.8+
* The following base libraries:

libz
libxml2
libcrypto
libcurl
libiconv

Basically everything that MacOS comes with.
