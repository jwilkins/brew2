* brew doctor will scan for all base deps on the system too so that we can be used
  on Linux

* cache git checkouts as eg. foo.git. Should be possible to pull multiple
  histories into same .git folder and then checkout as appropriate

* make brew upgrade show which formula are new versions and which are just updates
  to some other part of the formula

* proper handling for etc files (make a new git repo and version control them)
